No, not this time.  I cannot celebrate <br>
a man’s discarded life, and will not try; <br>
these knee-jerk elegies perpetuate<br>
the nightshade lies of Plath.  Why glorify<br>
descent into a solipsistic hell?<br>
Stop.  Softly curse the waste.  Don’t elevate<br>
his suffering to genius.  Never tell <br>
me he will live on.  Never call it fate. <br>

Attend the service.  Mourn.  Pray.  Comfort those<br>
he lacerated.  Keep him in your heart,<br>
but use that grief to teach.  When you compose<br>
a line, it is a message, not just art.<br>
Be furious with me, but I refuse<br>
to praise him.  No, we have too much to lose.
