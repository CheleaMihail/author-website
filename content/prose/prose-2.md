**“Casey at the Bat” and its Long Post-Game Show**

This year marks the 125th anniversary of “Casey at the Bat,” a 52-line narrative about the ninth inning of a professional baseball game, which is perhaps the most enduring poem of American popular culture. Its only rival for that distinction is Clement Moore’s 1823 poem, “Twas the Night Before Christmas.”

“Casey at the Bat” captured public attention in an era when newspapers, not literary journals, were the main channel of distribution for poetry. The *San Francisco* *Examiner* published “Casey” as the work of “Phin” (an undergraduate nickname of the author) on June 3, 1888. The following month *The New York* *Sporting Times* published an unauthorized and outrageously edited version, and then the *New York Sun* reprinted the original text shortly thereafter.

The *Sun* publication caught the eye of a successful comedian named De Wolfe Hopper (whose son William would later star as the detective Paul Drake on *The Perry Mason Show*). With future Hall of Famer Tim Keefe and many New York Giants in the audience, Hopper recited “Casey” in an August 1888 performance and allegedly recited it over ten thousand times over the course of a career built primarily on these recitations. You can read the original text of “Casey” and hear a Hopper performance of the poem at [www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_case.shtml](http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_case.shtml).

Tens of millions of Americans memorized these 13 quatrains of somewhat ragged fourteeners. (Fourteeners are written in lines typically having 14 syllables and seven feet.) Parodies and unauthorized “sequels” soon followed, and in 1926 the legendary sportswriter Grantland Rice wrote a tribute poem called “He Never Heard of Casey!” that mocked a fictional odd duck who had never heard of the poem. Rice also wrote his poem in quatrains of ragged fourteeners, although he needed one more quatrain than “Casey” did. You can read Rice’s poem at [www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_case4.shtml](http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_case4.shtml). The Secretary’s Report for the 30th reunion of Thayer’s Harvard Class complained about all these parodies and imitations, in addition to complaining about Anheuser-Busch’s use of the poem to sell beer.

“Casey” stimulated artistic as well as beer executives’ imaginations. In addition to a 1927 silent film version in which the author refused to appear, Disney released a film adaptation in 1946. In 1955 the highbrow CBS show *Omnibus* broadcast William Schuman’s opera “The Mighty Casey,” which played to sharply divided reviews. You can judge the merits of its title song for yourself at [www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7peip8e1ps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7peip8e1ps).

Rod Serling’s legendary TV show, *The Twilight Zone*, broadcast an ill-fated episode called “The Mighty Casey” in 1960. It involved a robot named Casey who played baseball; the episode had to be reshot because one of the lead actors was visibly ill and died shortly thereafter of a heart attack. The poem subsequently popped up from time to time on other hit shows such as *Northern Exposure* and *The Simpsons*. Rock stars also appreciated the poem; there are allusions to it in the lyrics of Joe Walsh, John Fogerty, Blues Traveler, and Death Cab for Cutie. Garrison Keillor wrote a poem from the perspective of his imagined Mudville Nine opponents, the Dustburg Nine, which concludes:

But there is no joy in Dustburg, no joy so pure and sweet
As when the mighty Casey fell, demolished at our feet.

Beloved polymath Martin Gardner edited a version of “Casey at the Bat” in 1967 and future Poet Laureate Donald Hall published an edition in 1988. Stephen Jay Gould, the distinguished science writer, alluded to the poem in the title of his 2004 book, *Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville*.

As with “Twas the Night Before Christmas,” authorship of “Casey” was originally unclear. Opportunists tried to claim the poem as their own, most notably George Whitefield D’Vys (1860-1941), and there are still some holdout conspiracy theorists who challenge the authorship of Ernest Lawrence Thayer. Thayer was a brilliant philosophy student but an awkward man who was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, on August 14, 1863, into a wealthy Massachusetts manufacturing family. After graduating from Worcester Classical High, where he was the editor of a satirical underground paper called the *Monohippic Gazette*, he entered Harvard in 1881, edited *The Harvard Lampoon* from1884-1885, and graduated *magna cum laude* in Philosophy (having studied under William James) in 1885.

Thayer’s *Harvard Lampoon* staff was talented and privileged. Future philosopher George Santayana was an editor who focused on illustrations, and William Randolph Hearst, the inspiration for *Citizen Kane*, was a business editor. Thayer was neither the most accomplished nor prolific poet of his peer group; most of his contributions were brief “insider” prose pieces. The *Lampoon*’s premier poet, Thomas Parker Sanborn, succeeded Thayer as editor in 1886, then committed suicide in 1889.

Thayer wrote at least 11 credited poems for the *Lampoon*, and probably deserves full or partial credit for some of the anonymous work. His debut, in 1882, was a dreadful long poem called “The Soldier’s Prayer,” which Thayer apparently intended as a spoof of P.T. Barnum. It involves a female horseback rider with dramatic hair, in addition to an armless soldier who nonetheless manages to lift his arm. Almost equally bad was “Wit *VS.* Strength,” three quatrains in heroic couplets that emphatically argue without wit or apparent irony that it is swell that modern men woo modern women with words rather than swords. The young Thayer’s “A Spring Morning” borders on the incoherent and his unrhymed quatrain “To a Boardinghouse Steak” is a butchered attempt to be funny based on failed wordplay between “chews” and “choose.”

Thayer’s Harvard poems have just a few hints of either “Casey” or any poetic talent at all. I will spare you the forty-nine quatrains of his mock epic “Ye Romaunt of a Warte,” but this narrative about Hermann of England, an antihero with a skin problem who survives a trick ending, does perhaps flash a few slight intimations of “Casey.”

Much of Thayer’s better juvenilia discussed young love. As *Lampoon* editor his senior year, he allowed himself the indulgence of publishing a sober but sweet love lyric called “Love and Music,” which ends clumsily with mixed metaphors. “The Landlord’s Cruel Daughter” is twenty lines of dull set-up for a moderately amusing punch line.

The paired four-line poems “Rhapsody” and “Recantation,” while awkwardly executed, are punchier than “The Landlord’s Cruel Daughter” and involve the successful premise of a young man quickly falling in love and then falling out of love just as quickly based on a second look at his beloved. To my mind, Thayer’s most successful *Lampoon* poems were his taut 1883 “A Pastoral” with its weird but hilarious punch line and his self-deprecatory 1884 “How Maria Felt” (despite the atrocious “inquire/Maria” rhyme). I am grateful to Harvard University for allowing *Light* to publish these poems for the first time since the Administration of Chester A. Arthur:

   A Pastoral

Cheering are sweet Thetis’ smiles;<br>
Cheering, too, are riches; <br>
But nothing’s quite so cheering as<br>
A hornet in your breeches.<br>

How Maria Felt

I held her soft warm hand in mine
     Good gracious, how it thrilled me!
Its contact made me feel divine
     And with sweet po’sy filled me.

I wondered if my horny palm
     Produced a sim’lar feelin’;
And thought it wouldn’t do no harm
     To find out by appealin’.

But ’fore I could of her inquire
     She cried out sudden, “Sammy!”—
I softly murmured, “yes, Maria”—
     “Your hand is cold and clammy.”
